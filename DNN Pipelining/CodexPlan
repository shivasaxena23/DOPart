DOPart: Current Behavior and System Model

What DOPart currently does
- DOPart currently operates as an experiment/simulation pipeline for DNN partition policies, not as an online deployment runtime.
- Main driver: project/plot.py.
- It sweeps an alpha axis (alpha_min to alpha_max with step period), and for each alpha point generates 7000 random samples.
- For each sample, it builds:
  - Local compute times by scaling per-layer remote times with sampled alpha values.
  - Communication delays by combining activation/input sizes with sampled bandwidth values.
- It evaluates multiple algorithms per sample, including:
  - DOPart (deterministic threshold)
  - DOPart-R (single random threshold)
  - DOPart-DR (fresh random threshold each step)
  - DOPart-AR (adaptive randomized threshold)
  - DOPart-DAR (currently aliased to DOPart-DR in code)
  - Threat Based (TBP)
  - OPT baseline (best split in hindsight)
- It aggregates average makespan across samples and plots Average Makespan vs Alpha, then saves a PDF figure.
- Some algorithms are intentionally ignored via IGNORED_ALGS = {0, 2, 6, 8} to reduce runtime in current experiments.

System model of the problem
- The model is single-cut DNN partitioning over a sequential layer stack.
- Decision variable: choose one split index i.
  - Layers before i execute locally.
  - Layers from i onward execute remotely.
  - A single communication transfer cost is paid at i.

Latency model
- Total latency for split i is modeled as:
  T_i = sum_{k < i}(L_k) + C_i + sum_{k >= i}(R_k)

Where:
- L_k: local compute time of layer k.
- R_k: remote compute time of layer k.
- C_i: communication time if partition occurs at i.

How model values are generated in current code
- Remote profile R_k for stage 0 is taken from profiled ResNet data in resnet34_compute_values_224_t4.npy (mean over selected samples).
- Local profile L_k is generated as alpha_k * R_k, where alpha_k is sampled from either uniform or log-uniform ranges controlled by CLI arguments.
- Communication is generated from layer input/activation size and sampled bandwidth.

Optimization objective
- Minimize makespan T_i.
- OPT gives the best offline split (minimum over all i for each sample).
- DOPart and its randomized/adaptive variants are online threshold policies that decide when to stop and offload under uncertainty.

Current interpretation
- Practically, the repository models the partition decision as an online-search/one-way-trading style stopping problem applied to DNN split selection, under uncertainty in local compute scaling and communication conditions.
